# myGigApp

<p>myGigApp Project is a simple project for user to post project and let the company knows what the project they wanted with suitable payment.<br>

However, this project still in base level to be functional you may added some of the specific features on what criteria you have.<br>

Just to mention, this project developed for my training program and inspired me to learn more about react.</p>

<p>I build the system with using <a href="https://codebridge.my/">CodeBridge</a> generator as startup of the project as well as <a href="https://feathersjs.com/">feathersjs</a> for the backend structure and <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/primereact/">primereact</a> for UI/UX</p>

> #### Starting the system
> - In the terminal cd to nodebackend and type <i>npm start</i>
> - In the terminal cd to reactfrontend and type <i>npm start</i>
